# Hybrid-Solar-Panel
Hybrid Solar Panel that can be use in contrasting weather condition with help of piezoelectric transducer to convert rain kinetic energy to electrical energy. It Also has automation via solar tracker and applied ai to predict electrical output depending on the value of temperature and humidity base on sensor readings.
